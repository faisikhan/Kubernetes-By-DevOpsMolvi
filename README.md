# Kubernetes

1. One of the most popular tools for container orchestration.
2. A node means a server in Kubernetes.
3. A cluster means a number of servers coupled together. In Kubernetes, there should be at least 2 nodes in a cluster:

i.  Master Node
It is the main node in Kubernetes which does the administration part, it runs kubeadm. Kubeadm performs the actions necessary to get a minimum viable cluster up and running quickly. 

ii. worker node
